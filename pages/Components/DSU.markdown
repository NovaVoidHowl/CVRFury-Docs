## DSU (Data Storage Unit)

This is the core component for each prefab.\
It is intended that you add one (and only one), to the root gameObject of your prefab.

This is also the component that allows you to import compatible modules from converted VRCFury prefabs (a DSU is
automatically added to the root of all converted prefabs)

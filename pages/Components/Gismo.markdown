## Gismo

All this does is show an editor gizmo. It does nothing in game. Useful primarily for prop artists who wish to identify
something on their prop without including it in the upload.

Note: the Gismo component has two modes of operation, stand alone and DSU linked, by having the component linked you can
centralise config of multiple components throughout a prefab.

> Note there is currently no config UI for the DSU beyond the dev mode UI, this is not intended for general use but is
> functional

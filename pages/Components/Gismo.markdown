## Gismo

All this does is show an editor gizmo. It does nothing in game. Useful primarily for prop artists who wish to identify
something on their prop without including it in the upload.

Note: the Gismo component has two modes of operation, stand alone and [DSU](/components/dsu) linked, by having the
component linked you can centralise config of multiple components throughout a prefab.
